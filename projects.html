                    <p>I'm 25 now.</p>
                    <p>It's time I start creating things instead of consuming.</p>
                    <p>I've decided I will do one project a week. Can be something small or ambitious. But I need to start making deadlines for myself
                    and think about where I want to end up in life. Also have some fun and learn lots of shit along the way.</p>

                    <p>I have tried to create a website so many times before from scratch and so many times it has failed. I have at least 10 folders somewhere on my computer with half finished websites.
                    But with the help of Chat-GPT and my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I learned oh so many years ago, this website is now it. It's a basic website but it has everything I need for now.

                  </div>
                  <p>I have alot of ideas to add for this website such as books/movies I am going through or further functionality to make adding content less awkward.</p>
